# BASC Assignments - 2024/2025

This repository contains the assignments for the **BASC (Binary Analysis and Secure Coding)** course, part of the **2024/2025** academic year. The course covers various aspects of binary analysis, secure coding, and exploitation techniques.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a series of challenges designed to deepen your understanding of topics such as:

- **Static Analysis of Binaries**: Techniques for analyzing executable files without running them, understanding their structure, and identifying potential issues.
  
- **Debugging**: Learning how to use debugging tools to inspect and manipulate the execution of programs to understand their behavior and identify bugs.

- **Reverse Engineering**: Deconstructing compiled programs to understand their logic and uncover hidden functionality or vulnerabilities.

- **Shellcoding**: Writing small snippets of machine code (shellcodes) that can be injected into programs to execute malicious actions.

- **Buffer Overflows**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in programs that fail to properly handle input data, often leading to security breaches, such as buffer overflow vulnerabilities exploited using techniques like ROP chains.

- **Advanced Reverse Engineering**: More complex techniques and challenges related to reverse engineering, focusing on overcoming advanced protections and obfuscations.

## Structure

- **Challenges**: Each directory represents a challenge or assignment with detailed instructions on the problem to solve.
  
- **Solutions**: The corresponding solutions and explanations can be found within each assignment's directory in the report, allowing for self-paced learning and progress tracking.

## Skills and Tools

The assignments require familiarity with the following skills and tools:

- Disassemblers (e.g., Ghidra)
- Debuggers (e.g., GDB, x64dbg)
- Assembly language
- Knowledge of common vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, etc.)
- Exploitation techniques

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Then, navigate to each challenge directory and follow the instructions provided.
